## Shapekey Master Converter

Converts your ShapeAnimator.xml into ShapeKeyMaster.Json

### How to use:

Download ShapekeyMasterConverter.exe and run it.  
If COM3D2 has proper entries in the registry everything is automated,
ShapeKeyMaster.Json will be created and placed in BepinEx\config\ where it belongs.

If any ShapeAnimator.xml is present alongside the program, it will be used instead,
in this case ShapeKeyMaster.Json will also be created alongside the program, charge to you to
place it correctly afterward.



### Notes:
ShapeAnimator.xml is left untouched during the process.  
Any previous ShapeKeyMaster.Json in the destination folder will be backed up.  
Animated shape keys will be ported as static ones as both plugins use different methodes.

### Knon issues
Maids without Name or Surname may need to be reassigned until I find a solution:
In ShapeKeyMaster's UI > Maid tab > find your maid > rename > select the correct one.
